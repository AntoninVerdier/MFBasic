# MyceFasterBetter - A minimalist framework for MFB-reward tasks

MyceFasterBetter is a ensemble of code and instructions to build a simple working MFB (Medial Forebrain Bundle Stimulation) apparatus to be used for behavioral learning in mice. It uses an Arduino Uno as a base and send TTLs to chosen outputs to time both the stimulus and the reward. A small processing GUI is used to keep track of the ongoing protocol.

### Hardware

In order to build the stimulation apparatus, a [List of Parts](https://github.com/AntoninVerdier/MyceFasterBetter/blob/master/ListOfParts.md) and 3D models are provided on this repo as well as a [Electronic scheme](https://nothing.org). 

### Software requirements

- Arduino IDE: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
- Processing: https://processing.org/download

### Run

Once build, you need to connect the Arduino to a computer and select the relevant Board and Port in the Arduino IDE. Upload the script to the arduino, open the Processing script and launch it.
